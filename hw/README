There is a bug in which the run does not complete and runs forever. This happens sometimes but not always and I did not have the time to find it before the end of my internship.
My debugging shows that it has to do with OPAE reads and writes to on-board memory that sometimes do not complete. 
If you find the bug, please feel free to contact anyone to make the necessary fixes
